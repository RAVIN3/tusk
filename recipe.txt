algo_definition_and_steps


algorithms : it is combination of sequence(can not change order of sequence) of finite steps (for finite time) to solve a particular Problem.
steps to design a algo:
1: problem definition ( what kind of I\O participate.)

2: Design algo(DAC, GT, DP, BROOT FORCE, BACK TRACKIG.)

3: Flow chart()

4: Verification(Testing and again algorithm design.)

5: Implimantation( Now computer will run the the Program. )

6: Analysis(CPU time, Memory time)
